        <h1 MadCap:autonum="">Generate the Report on Windows</h1>
        <p class="BodyAfterHead">The report generation can take some time. As it runs, different messages might warn you that some commands have exceeded their timeout, and provide you the option to abort the current command. Wait a few minutes before clicking.</p>
        <p class="Body">When report generation is finished, a message box displays a list of the names and paths of the generated files and instructions for various methods of sending them to Atempo. See <MadCap:xref href="Sending_the_Environment_Reporter_FTP.htm">Sending the Environment Reporter by FTP</MadCap:xref> for details on sending the report by FTP.</p>
        <p class="Body">When you click <b>OK</b>, you are returned to the previous window, on which the <b>Cancel</b> button is now replaced by the <b>Close the window</b> and <b>Split Result</b> buttons.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Lead-In">Split Result.</span> Select this option to split the Environment Report into segments of desired size. The smaller file sizes speed the transmittal of the report to Atempo, so this option has a default of <span class="Monospace">2</span>Â MB.</p>
