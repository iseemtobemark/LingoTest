        <p class="BodyAfterHead">These topics describe the organization of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> agents.</p>
        <p class="BodyAfterHead">To facilitate the administration of agents in the <MadCap:variable name="ALN.ade_admin" /> you can:</p>
        <p class="Bulleted" MadCap:autonum="• ">Divide the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> agents declared in the server into agent <span class="Bold">groups</span>. You can create several groups but each of them must have its own name. A protection set to an agent group can be inherited by any agent added to that group.</p>
        <p class="Bulleted" MadCap:autonum="• ">You can create several views. Each one must have its own name. The agent groups created constitute a <span class="interface">view</span>. A view represents the highest level in the organization. </p>
        <p class="Description">An agent group called <span class="interface">No protection inheritance</span> is automatically created in the <MadCap:variable name="ALN.adm_exe" />. You cannot delete it but you can duplicate it. This group contains all the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> agents that have not yet been assigned to other groups. This group cannot be deleted.</p>
