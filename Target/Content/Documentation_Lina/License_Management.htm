        <p class="Introduction">When you install a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> server, you automatically start with a 30-day evaluation license. To configure <MadCap:variable name="ALN.license_doc" />, you must request a permanent standard license file from Atempo. </p>
        <p>The Lina server regularly counts the number of used licenses. However, the Lina server does not prohibit the declaration of new agents when the number of available licenses is reached.</p>
        <p>When the number of active agents is higher than the number of authorized licenses, the Lina server places additional agents in the list of blocked agents (missing license alarm in the Agents view). These agents cannot be backed up, but they remain restorable. </p>
        <p>In the Notifications view, several alarms are issued before all licenses are used. In the meantime, the administrator can buy new licenses, delete agents, or place them in archived or disabled mode. You can also monitor the license status, using the <span class="Bold">License</span> tile In the dashboard of the Lina Administration Console. Disabled agents can be tracked in the agent list, using the block status column.</p>
