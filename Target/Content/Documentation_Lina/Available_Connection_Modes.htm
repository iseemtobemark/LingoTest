        <h1 MadCap:autonum="">Available Connection Modes</h1>
        <p class="BodyAfterHead">These are the two available connection modes:</p>
        <p class="Bulleted" style="font-family: Arial;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;font-size: 11pt;letter-spacing: 0em;text-decoration: none;" MadCap:autonum="• "><span class="Lead-In">HTTPS.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="BulletedCont">When using an HTTPS connection, data is always encrypted with a 256-bit symmetric key. In addition, HTTPS enables agents to verify the identity of the server prior to sending any data through the network certificates. This mode is well suited for WAN environments. Note that the HTTPS mode is resource consuming for the server.</p>
        <p class="Bulleted" style="font-family: Arial;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;font-size: 11pt;letter-spacing: 0em;text-decoration: none;" MadCap:autonum="• "><span class="Lead-In">HTTP.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="BulletedCont">In HTTP mode, there is no default encryption except for the authentication information, that is systematically encrypted. This mode is well suited for LAN environments.</p>
