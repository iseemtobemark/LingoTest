        <h1 MadCap:autonum="">Create a Dynamic Server Access file</h1>
        <p class="BodyAfterHead">Under the <span class="Monospace">HNDB</span> folder of your agent, create a file named <span class="Monospace">ServerDynamicPaths.def</span>, and edit it.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can both use the special character <span class="Monospace">*</span> and add as many lines as needed. The <span class="Monospace">*</span> wildcard can fully replace a name or an address, or only a part of it. The first line that matches the current gateway is used, and then any subsequent lines are ignored.</p>
