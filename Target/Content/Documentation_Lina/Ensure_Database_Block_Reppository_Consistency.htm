        <p>The product reliability depends on its database and block repository consistency. To ensure that you run a consistent system, a set of tools is provided to check, repair, and clean up your data.</p>
        <p>If a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" MadCap:conditions="ALN.ALN" /><MadCap:variable name="ALN.hys_exe" MadCap:conditions="ALN.HSS" /> restore process fails and reports missing or corrupted blocks, it is possible that your system suffers from hardware issues or file system corruption. A hard drive failure of the disk where the block files are stored, or a file system corruption may lead to missing or corrupted blocks.</p>
        <p>As a consequence, ensure that your system is completely healthy and that the server has enough free space prior to going through the maintenance steps described in this section. The necessary amount of free space must be at least equal to the size of your database.</p>
