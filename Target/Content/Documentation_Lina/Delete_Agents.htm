        <p class="BodyAfterHead">If an agent no longer exists or if you no longer want to protect it, you can delete it from the server. When you do so, the deletion process starts. The agent is put in a “delete” mode. At this point you can no longer restore data from the agent.</p>
        <p class="Body">The complete deletion of an agent can be quite lengthy, depending on the volume of data backed up for the agent, as blocks must be processed one by one by maintenance tasks. </p>
        <p>Due to deduplication, the amount of storage space freed when an agent is deleted does not correspond to the amount of data backed up for the agent. The highest the deduplication ratio, the smallest the amount of space freed following the deletion of an agent.</p>
